# proxy

This code has not been tested in a production environemnt. I wrote this while I was learning golang as an experiment. I wanted to have a simple networking app that I could compare with a similar Node.js project. You can find the Node.js version at https://github.com/etsy/statsd/blob/master/proxy.js.

## Install

```
$ go get github.com/dmcaulay/proxy
```

## Test
```
$ godep go test
```

## Run
```
$ godep go install
$ proxy
```
